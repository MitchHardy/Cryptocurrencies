# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a report for a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to present to an investment bank. This report will include what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Unsupervised machine learning is being used on the data. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on using a clustering algorithm. I'll use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.
